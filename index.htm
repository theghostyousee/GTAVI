            >1. Never Invest More than You Can Afford to Lose<br /></span
          ><br />Any successful and reasonable investor will tell you to only
          invest in as much as you can afford to lose. This applies to all
          markets, and even more so to crypto, which can see double-digit drops
          in hours. The current investing world has its fair share of reckless
          investors, who throw away life savings on a handful of stocks, but
          that is a surefire path to doom.<br /><br />The crypto market has seen
          unprecedented growth in value and just-as-large drops in value. It’s
          still a nascent market, without regulatory checks and early-stage
          technical barriers. This can lead to some unfortunate situations, such
          as hacks, fraud, and a flurry of sell orders that might appear to
          happen on a whim.<br /><br /><span class="boldhead"
            >2. Use Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA)<br /></span
          ><br />The principle of dollar-cost averaging (DCA) very much applies
          to the crypto market. DCA is used to beat volatility, and the latter
          is a major characteristic of the market. By investing small amounts
          over time, you can stem any losses and make more efficient use of your
          capital.It is worth noting that, by using this method, you will pay a
          little more in network fees, but any gains you make should render this
          negligible. You could do this on a weekly or monthly basis—the details
          are left up to you. If you feel particularly positive about where the
          market is going, then you can set aside some extra capital for when
          the market seems to be at a low.<br /><br /><span class="boldhead"
            >3. Research in Detail, Stick to the Fundamentals<br /></span
          ><br />Research still matters in the crypto market. While it’s not as
          clear-cut and direct as investing in a publicly traded company, it
          still plays an important part in the investment process. The process
          of researching cryptocurrencies for investment could be an entire
          topic on its own, but here, it is out of the scope of the
          discussion.<br /><br />Some of the principles with which you will
          guide your research are whether the project and crypto in question
          have a valuable and unique use case, the technical elements of the
          project, the management team, and the potential to disrupt the
          particular industry or space in which it is working.<br /><br />However,
          in all cases, you should always focus on the fundamentals. Does the
          project have a transparent and honest team? Do the financials, in
          terms of expenditure and allocation toward investors, add up? Does the
          technology seem like something that has genuine potential?<br /><br /><span
            class="boldhead"
            >4. Stick to the Major Assets<br /></span
          ><br />Of course, for many, the comparatively complicated and novel
          way of researching cryptocurrencies may be intimidating. For these
          individuals, it may just be better to stick to the major assets that
          have survived the test of time. Bitcoin and Ethereum are the best
          examples of these assets and have endured many rough bear markets.
          <br /><br />There are several others as well, though it becomes much
          harder to say whether those other major assets with large market
          capitalizations have the potential to survive in the future. This
          applies to Bitcoin and Ethereum as well, though the consensus is that
          these two have already proven themselves worth considering.<br />‍<br /><span
            class="boldhead"
            >5. Use Safe Storage<br /></span
          ><br />The principle of dollar-cost averaging (DCA) very much applies
          to the crypto market. DCA is used to beat volatility, and the latter
          is a major characteristic of the market. By investing small amounts
          over time, you can stem any losses and make more efficient use of your
          capital.<br /><br />It is worth noting that, by using this method, you
          will pay a little more in network fees, but any gains you make should
          render this negligible. You could do this on a weekly or monthly
          basis—the details are left up to you. If you feel particularly
          positive about where the market is going, then you can set aside some
          extra capital for when the market seems to be at a low.<br /><br /><span
            class="boldhead"
            >6. Employ Common Sense<br /></span
          ><br />Above all, investing in the crypto market requires common
          sense. It is easy to get swept up in the hype and commotion
          surrounding a spanking new project, but more often than not, this
          leads to heavy losses. It is even easier to get involved in a meme
          token that rises considerably purely from a rallying of individuals
          online—like Dogecoin—but this is a double-edged sword, with one side
          much sharper than the other. <br /><br />Like with the stock market,
          you want to diversify. There are several projects working on some key
          problems and use cases, and these have the potential to cause some
          major disruption. It is not guaranteed, but like with the various
          sectors in the stock market, you can apportion your capital across
          these projects.
